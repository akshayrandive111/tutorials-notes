Spring Fundamentals:-

Development with or without EJB
Development without application server, tomcat is web server

Problem solved by Spring:-
1. Testability
2. Scalability
3. Maintainability
4. Complexity
5. Business Focus:- e.g. For single select query we need to add jdbc connection, try catch block , finally block .
but this thing can be managed by jdbctemplate in single line


applicationContext.xml replaced by @Configuration

Bean scopes:-
1. Singleton:- default scope
2. Prototype:- unique for every request, opposite if singleton
3. request:- bean per http request
4. session:- bean till the time session is alive
5. global:- alive till application undeployed or rebooted
